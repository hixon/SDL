# SDL
Playing around with some SDL stuff
After watching the Programming a text editor in C (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzkeezwAc67C9ttn35U4GiQ/videos). This seemed like a cool thing to learn some graphics programming. 

This project is being developed using Visual Studio 2017, it should run basically anywhere as long as the SDL2.dll is linked

- as of now the project will allow for typing up to 32 characters per line before wrapping

NEXT STEPS:
- setup a char array to save all currently typed info 
- fix how wrapping is done so that words can be kept together
